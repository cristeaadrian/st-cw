# README

This repository can be imported to Eclipse.

TemplateEngineTest.java contains four simple JUnit tests to show how to import the package of our implementation and how to write JUnit tests. 

For black box testing (wrting JUnit tests), please use the Jar file under the jar/ directory and write your tests according to the specifications (see Specifications.pdf)

Source code of the implementation is under the src/ directory. Use this to achieve high code coverage.
