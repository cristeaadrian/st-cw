/*
Software Testing Coursework 1 - Part 2: Coverage Analysis (20 Marks)
Collaborators: Adrian Cristea (s1449640) & Andra Zaharia (s1402967)

Specification:
1. Take the JUnit tests you developed in "Task 1 Functional Testing", and measure the branch coverage achieved.
Run the JUnit tests on the source code of the implementation, which is available in the folder "src/st" in the Github repository.
Submit a screenshot showing the coverage achieved by tests developed in "Part 1 Functional Testing", as reported by a coverage measurement tool.

2. Attempt to improve the branch coverage achieved over the source code to "maximum possible" by adding more tests.
You can look at the source code and its structure to guide the development of additional tests.

Please note that "maximum possible" branch coverage may be less than 100% since there may be parts of the code that
are unreachable in the provided implementation.

Re-assess branch coverage achieved with these additional tests along with tests from Part 1.

Please submit all the JUnit tests used to achieve maximum coverage, and a screenshot showing the improved branch coverage
as reported by a coverage measurement tool like EclEmma.
